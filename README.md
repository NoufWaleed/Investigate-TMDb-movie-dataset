# Investigate-TMDb-movie-dataset

 Investigate dataset using NumPy and Pandas

I choose the TMDb movie data set for data analysis.

This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.I would like to find other intresting patterns in the dataset.

## Getting Started

you should have seaborn, numpy, pandas and matplotlib.pyplot.

### And coding style tests

The file formatted to contain: 
1- A note specifying which dataset i analyzed
2- A statement of the questions i posed
3- A description of what i did to investigate those questions
4- Summary statistics and plots communicating final results

The HTML is easier to read.
