# Investigate-TMDb-movie-dataset

 Investigate dataset using NumPy and Pandas

I choose Red wine to analysis.
This data set contains 1,599 red wines with 11 variables on the chemical properties of the wine. At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).

Guiding Question: 
Which chemical properties influence the quality of red wines?

## Getting Started

you should have seaborn, numpy, pandas and matplotlib.pyplot.

### And coding style tests

The file formatted to contain: 
1- A note specifying which dataset i analyzed
2- A statement of the questions i posed
3- A description of what i did to investigate those questions
4- Summary statistics and plots communicating final results

The HTML is easier to read.
